# JMGBE

This is a personal project where I try to create an original Game Boy emulator with pure C# in .Net Core 3.0.

This repo containse the following projects:
- JMGBE.Core: The main class library with all the components of the emulator [.Net standard 2.1].
- JMGBE.GUI: A MonoGame project used to interact visually with the emulator [.Net core 3.0].
