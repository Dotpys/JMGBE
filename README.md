# JMGBE

This is a personal project where I try to create an original Game Boy emulator with pure C# in .Net 5.

This repo containse the following projects:
- JMGBE.Core: The main class library with all the components of the emulator [net5.0].
- JMGBE.GUI: A MonoGame project used to interact visually with the emulator [net5.0-windows].
