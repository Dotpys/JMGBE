# JMGBE

This is a personal project where I try to create an original Game Boy emulator with pure C# in .Net Core 3.0.

This repo containse the following projects:
- JMGBE: The main class library with all the components of the emulator.
- JMGBEDBG: The "debugger". This is a console project used to test the correct execution of CPU operations.
- JMGBEVDBG: The "visual debugger". This is a WPF application that i use to test the GPU and to see what's inside of it.

- M: Made (Kinda cringe right?)
- G: Game
- B: Boy
